<h2> Minecraft-DT2 - Launcher (In progress)</h2>

Minecraft-DT2 is a superiour software to outdated MDT launcher: Original project: [Minecraft-DT-Classic](https://github.com/gubrus50/Minecraft-Development-Tools-Classic#what-is-minecraft-dt/)

[Download now v0.1.5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U-w0nR4g5hd0BCar8cE_8AtlD6afhZyS/view?usp=share_link)

<h4>History</h4>
The first generation of MDT is buggy and unsupported as it runs on:
<ul>
  <li>HTA (Html Application), and</li>
  <li>IE9 (Internet Explorer 9).</li>
</ul>
It is one of my first-ever projects. Hence, unprofessionalism. To redeem my past self and deliver the software people deserve, I decided to create an improved and stable Launcher with its new, polished Development Tool: Command Creation Generator.
