## WHAT IS Minecraft-DT?
Minecraft-DT is a simple launcher for special development tools ([``check our tools``](https://github.com/gubrus50/Minecraft-Development-Tools/blob/master/README.md#download---tools)). Those tools are providing the user with some editors that can save their time. For example one of our tool known as ``Command Creation Generator`` supports ``Visual Display and Text Editor`` for the Sign, and also provides the user with additional ``Creation Editor`` which allows user to generate their own [``Minecraft Command Creation``](https://github.com/gubrus50/Minecraft-Development-Tools#what-is-command-creation)


> <b>News</b> about the application can be found at **[Minecraft-Development-Tools/releases](https://github.com/gubrus50/Minecraft-Development-Tools/releases)**

## WHAT IS Command Creation?
<p>Command creation is a smart container that stores many <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Command_Block" target="_blank">command blocks</a>. Most of the modern command creations usually contain a user friendly interface that allows the user to toggle "On" and/or "Off" the commands that are within the container. Once activated, those command blocks will then run a series of complex algorythym.
<br /><br />
Command creations are usually summoned by one or more command blocks. They are found to be useful as they can be easilly and quickly exported to the world. This means that you don't have to download a complete new world or a schematic to use them.</p>

## WHAT IS A TOOL?
<li>A tool is basically an html application which can be launched by Minecraft-DT.</li>
<li>Most of the tools should be baised on the game called minecraft.</li>
<li>They provide useful mecanics to help out minecraft engineers in some basic or complex tasks.</li>

<br />

## HOW TO CREATE MY OWN TOOL?
<li>To create your own tool, you must learn the following programming launguages; HTML-HTA and JavaScript-jQuery.</li>

<li>You should be able to see the folder called "Default".</li>
<li>Everything is organised for you, the only thing that you must take focus on is the HTA file called "run".</li>
<li>This is your tool display which will appear when launched by Minecraft-DT.</li>
<li>Now you must design your tool, make a plan of what you want your tool to do</li>
<li>After that, you are required to do your coding part.</li>
<li>You can change your tools image which should be located in your tool "images" folder.</li>
